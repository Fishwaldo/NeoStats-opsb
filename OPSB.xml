  <title>OPSB Manual</title>

  <para>Welcome to the Open Proxy Scanning Bot (OPSB) Manual. This document
  will aid you in setting up and running OPSB on your IRC network.</para>

  <para>OPSB is a Proxy Scanning Service that scans connecting clients for
  Open Proxies. These Open Proxies are often used by malicious users and
  trojans to connect to your network and attack the network, users, or
  channels that you host. It bases its scanning engine on the BOPM proxy
  scanning library available at http://www.blitzed.org, but unlike the BOPM
  software, it has native support to scan all clients network wide, rather
  than via individual servers. This means that you only need one OPSB service
  running on your network to protect your entire IRC network. </para>

  <para>Additionally, OPSB makes use of Open Proxy lists. These lists often
  contain IP addresses of verified Open Proxies, and OPSB can ban these users
  without even scanning. By default, OPSB uses the blitzed open proxy list
  (More details available at http://opm.blitzed.org)</para>

  <para>OPSB is flexible in that it has many advanced configuration options
  available to IRC administrators, including the ability to easily modify the
  protocols and ports to scan of connecting users, as well as exclude certian
  users or servers from scanning. This allows you maxium flexibility without
  the overhead of running multiple copies of proxy scanning software. In
  addition, it has the ability to Queue up scans, so during periods of peak
  usage, OPSB will not consume all bandwidth or file descriptors, but still
  scan users in a timely manor. </para>

  <para>Proxy Scanning is only one defence against Trojans and Malicious
  users, and can not detect all types of open Proxies. We therefore recomend
  that the IRC administrators run other software such as SecureServ, and
  familiarize themselves with the OperServ functionality found in most
  traditional IRC services packages. </para>

  <para>By Default, OPSB scans the following protocols and ports (But this can
  be easily customized)</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>HTTP Proxies on Port 80, 3128, 8000, 8080</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>HTTP Post Proxies on Port 80, 3128, 8000, 8080</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Wingate Servers on Port 23</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Insecure Cisco Routers on port 23</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>SOCKS4 Servers on 1080</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>SOCKS5 Servers on 1080</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>These ports are some of the more common ports, but administrators
  might find other ports that are often associated with open proxies. In these
  cases, the administrator can simple add the new port to be scanning without
  restarting OPSB. </para>

  <warning>
    <para>When picking a host to run OPSB from, make sure you check with your
    Shell or ISP provider to ensure that there are no Transparent HTTP proxies
    enabled on that network. Transparent proxies are often used to speed up
    HTTP downloads for users without requiring the user to update their
    browser configuration. If you often get false positive scans on users on
    port 80, then most likely your hosting provider has implemented a
    Transparent Proxy. See if they can disable this transparent proxy for you,
    or alternativly, find a new hosting provider that does not run a
    transparent proxy. THERE IS NO WAY FOR OPSB TO DETECT IT IS BEHIND A
    TRANSPARENT PROXY.</para>
  </warning>

  <warning>
    <para>As of writting, this software is BETA quality. Not all functionality
    has been implemented, and additionally, there might be some &#34;BAD&#34;
    bugs in OPSB that cause it to AKILL your entire network. Our testing and
    Development of OPSB was run on a large network, and so far, has proved
    stable, and effective in protecting our network, BUT every users
    enviroment is different. While we have taken all precautions and conducted
    a extensive QA cycle before the release of OPSB, its a &#34;Use at your
    Own Risk&#34; Module. Of Course, if you do have bad experiences with OPSB,
    please let us know at <link linkend="???">http://www.neostats.net/boards/</link></para>
  </warning>

  <para>OPSB is written and maintained by Justin Hammond. It requires the
  NeoStats software. More information about OPSB, or NeoStats, can be found at

    <title>Prerequisites and Installation.</title>

    <para>OPSB is designed to run on Top of NeoStats. The Following
    requirements at the time of writting are required for NeoStats:<itemizedlist><listitem><para>A
    Linux or BSD based Server or Shell.</para></listitem><listitem><para>A
    supported IRCd. Currently, Hybrid7, Unreal, Ultimate2.x, Ultimate3.x,
    NeoIRCd, Bahumat</para></listitem><listitem><para>Some basic Unix
    administration Skill</para></listitem><listitem><para>Of Course, a IRC
    network to connect it all together.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para>

    <para>Please refer to the NeoStats website for more information on the
    requirements</para>

    <para>OPSB itself requires the following:<itemizedlist><listitem><para>NeoStats
    2.5.8 or Higher correctly installed and Running</para></listitem><listitem><para>The
    time to read this entire document. <warning><para>OPSB has the potential
    to Akill/Gline your entire network. Its strongly suggested that you read
    this entire document before even attempting to compile OPSB, as I&#39;m
    just going to laugh, if you didn&#39;t read, and it AKILL&#39;s your
    entire network. This is Beta Software, there are BUGS. beware.</para></warning></para></listitem></itemizedlist></para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Compiling and Installation</title>

      <para>As long as you have successfully setup NeoStats, and installed it
      correctly, Compiling OPSB is very simple and straight forward. First you
      must extract the files from the download package. This is as simple as:</para>

      <screen>bash$<command> tar -xzf OPSB-&#60;ver&#62;.tar.gz</command></screen>

      <para>This should then create a directory called OPSB-&#60;version&#62;
      where &#60;version&#62; is the Version of OPSB. Then Proceed to Change
      into the OPSB directory, and run Configure as follows:<screen>bash$<command>./configure [--enable-debug | --with-neostats=&#60;dir&#62;]</command></screen></para>

      <para>--enable-debug is only usefull for diagnostics purposes when used
      in conjuction with debugging tools. There should be no need to use this
      option on a day to day basis</para>

      <para>--with-neostats=&#60;dir&#62; should be used if your neostats
      directory is not in a standard location (~/NeoStats/). Replace
      &#60;dir&#62; with the full path to your NeoStats installation directory
      (NOT SOURCE DIRECTORY)</para>

      <para>Configuring OPSB will look something like the following screen:</para>

      <screen>[Fish@fish-dt]$ ./configure

      <para>Once Installation is complete, you can either configure NeoStats
      to load OPSB when it starts, or load OPSB via IRC.</para>

      <para>To Configure NeoStats to automatically load OPSB when it boots,
      add the following line to your &#34;neostats.cfg&#34; file in the
      NeoStats directory:</para>

      <para><command>LOAD_MODULE OPSB</command></para>

      <para>To load OPSB via IRC, you must make sure you have the appropriate
      permissions and issue the following command:</para>

      <para><command>/msg neostats load OPSB</command></para>

      <para>Thats it. OPSB is now loaded and ready for use (in fact, it will
      already be running now, but read on for futher information.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Basic Configuration</title>

    <para>OPSB is completly configured online via IRC. When you first start up
    OPSB, it attempts some &#34;Sane&#34; defaults for you to get started
    with, but you should always review these settings as soon as you install.
    Additionally, while its in this &#34;Default&#34; state, it will warn you
    every so often via a global message as well as messages to the services
    channel that it is still &#34;unconfigured&#34;. Some of the settings that
    you may want to review right away are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Exclusion Lists - You should setup a Exclude list for your IRC
        Services server (NickServ etc)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Target IP address and Ports that OPSB tries to get the proxies
        to connect to.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Default Ban Time when OPSB finds a open Proxy.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>These are outlined below:</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Exclusion Lists</title>

      <para>Exclusion lists allow you to specify certian Hostmasks or Servers
      that should be excluded from monitoring by OPSB. This exclusion list
      would allow a administrator to say, allow users on that are matched
      against a open proxy, when the administrator has verified that the
      trojan does not in fact exist on the users host. </para>

      <caution>
        <para>Exclusions should be setup for your Services Server, so that
        OPSB does not try to scan ChanServ, or NickServ, or any of the bots
        relating to Nickname protection.</para>
      </caution>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Adding a Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To add a entry to the Exclusion list, use the following format:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB exclude add &#60;1/0&#62; &#60;type&#62; &#60;reason&#62;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&#60;host&#62; = The HostName/Server or Channel name. WildCards ?
      and * are permitted.</para>

      <para>&#60;type&#62; = The type of exclusion. 0 is for HostNames, 1 is
      for Servers</para>

      <para>&#60;reason&#62; = a short description of the exclusion, for
      operator reference only.</para>

      <para>The output is as follows:</para>

      <screen>&#62;OPSB&#60; exclude add services.irc-chat.net 1 Blah is my reason
-OPSB- Added services.irc-chat.net (Server) exception to list</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Listing an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To list the Exclusions simple type:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB exclude list</screen>

      <para>And all the current exclusions are listed. Additionaly, a Position
      number is provided for use with the delete command. The output is as
      follows:</para>

      <screen>&#62;OPSB&#60; exclude list
-OPSB- Exception List:
-OPSB- 1) *.blah.com (Server) Added by Fish for Blah is my reason
-OPSB- 2) is.blah.com (HostName) Added by Fish for can by high
-OPSB- End of List.</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Deleting an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To delete a entry, you should first lookup the Position of the
      entry that you wish to delete. The format of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB exclude del &#60;num&#62;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&#60;num&#62; is the position of the entry you wish to delete in
      the list</para>

      <para>The output of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>&#62;OPSB&#60; exclude del 1
-OPSB- Deleted services.irc-chat.net server out of exception list</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>TARGET IP and TARGET PORT</title>

      <para>By default, OPSB sets up each proxy scan to attempt to connect
      back to the IP address and port of the server that NeoStats connects to.
      This may not always be what you wish, as it can help a attacker map our
      how your network is structured. Ideally, you should pick the IP address
      of a IRC server you host that is stable and on a fast connection, and
      enter its IP address and port numbers into OPSB. </para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Changing the TargetIP</emphasis></para>

      <para>To add a entry to the Helper list, use the following format:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set targetip &#60;newipaddress&#62;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&#60;newipaddress&#62; = The ip address to attempt to get proxies
      to connect to</para>

      <para>The output is as follows:</para>

      <screen> -&#62; *opsb* set targetip 203.208.228.144
=opsb= Target IP set to 203.208.228.144</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Changing the Target Port</emphasis></para>

      <para>To list the helpers simple type:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set targetport &#60;newport&#62;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&#60;newport&#62; = the new port to attempt to get proxies to
      connect to</para>

      <para>The output is as follows:</para>

      <screen> -&#62; *opsb* set targetport 6667
=opsb= Target PORT set to 6667</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>BanTime</title>

      <para>OPSB by default bans the IP/Hostname of a Open Proxy for 1 day
      (86400 seconds). Some networks may wish to increase or decrease this
      time value.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Changing the Ban Time</emphasis></para>

      <para>To change the bantime, type:</para>

      <screen> -&#62; *opsb* set bantime 86400
=opsb= Ban time changed to 86400</screen>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Detailed Configuration</title>

    <para>OPSB attempts to be as configurable as possible in order to cater
    for each individual networks requirements. This in turn though makes the
    configuration very complex. There are many many settings with OPSB that
    affect how it operates, how it responds and even, how affects the
    performance of NeoStats Overall. Out of the box, OPSB provides sensible
    defaults for these settings, but you may wish to read this section for
    details on exactly what each option does, and its affect on how OPSB
    operates.</para>

    <para>The following list summaries the available Options you can set in
    OPSB</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>CACHETIME </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DISABLESCAN</para>

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>MAXBYTES </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>SCANMSG</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>To change any of these settings, you use the Set Interface in OPSB.
    Eg:</para>

    <screen>/msg OPSB set &#60;option&#62; &#60;params&#62;</screen>

    <para>To view the current settings, issue the following command:</para>

    <screen>/msg OPSB set list</screen>

    <para>The following Sections describes the different options, their
    params, and the effect on OPSB in detail.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>CACHETIME Setting</title>

      <para>In order to improve performance, OPSB caches the results of scans
      it has performed so if a user disconnects and reconnects, they are not
      scanned again, and thus this saves bandwidth and improves the
      performance of OPSB. By default, OPSB saves previous scans for 1 hour.
      Smaller IRC networks may wish to increase this value, while larger IRC
      networks that are concerned about performance or memory usage of OPSB
      may with to leave this setting as it is. Setting the cache time to 0
      disables the use of caching, and forces OPSB to scan every user
      connecting every time. </para>

      <para>To Change the setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set CACHETIME &#60;seconds&#62; </screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>DISABLESCAN Setting</title>

      <para>Sometimes a IRC administrator may wish to only make use of the
      Open Proxy list lookup, and not actually perform a scan on users.
      DISABLESCAN forces OPSB to only perform a lookup of the IP address in
      the configured OPMDOMAIN. </para>

      <para>If you wish to turn off Proxy checks, issue the following command</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set DISABLESCAN &#60;ON/OFF&#62;</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>DOBAN Setting</title>

      <para>Often, when setting up OPSB for the first time, or making changes
      to the ports that are to be scanning, you may wish to test OPSB without
      it actually performing a AKILL. Turning DOBAN off disables the placement
      of a AKILL on open Proxy hosts. </para>

      <para>To Change the setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set DOBAN &#60;ON/OFF&#62; </screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>OPMDOMAIN Setting</title>

      <para>This setting changes with domain OPSB should consult for a
      positive match on a particular IP address. By Default, OPSB checks
      opm.blizted.org. Another list may be substituted instead of the default
      on. At this time, we have not tested any other open proxy list, although
      most lists should work with no problems. Please report success/failure
      to our boards</para>

      <para>To Change this Setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set OPMDOMAIN &#60;newdomain&#62;</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>MAXBYTES Setting</title>

      <para>Maxbytes controls how much data to read from a open connection
      before determining that the host in question does not contain a Open
      Proxy. As we check ports that are common with legitimate applications
      such as webservers, we don&#39;t need to download the entire webpage to
      determine that it is not a open proxy. By default, we only read 500
      bytes which should be sufficient for most networks. </para>

      <para>To Change this Setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set MAXBYTES &#60;bytelimit&#62;</screen>

      <title>TIMEOUT</title>

      <para>It is very common for users to now use personal firewall software
      on their PC. This often leads to probes the the users ip address that
      never actually get rejected or are successfull, but just hang trying to
      connect. the Timeout value controls how long to wait before assuming
      that the host is not operating a proxy. By default, we wait 30 seconds</para>

      <para>To Change this setting, issue the following command:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set TIMEOUT &#60;seconds&#62;</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>OPENSTRING</title>

      <para>This setting controls what strings to look for that indicate a
      Open Proxy. By default, we look for the standard string &#34;*** Looking
      up your hostname...&#34; which is one of the first messages sent to
      connecting IRC clients. There should be no need to change this setting.
      Internally, OPSB also scans for common Trottle or akill messages.</para>

      <para>To Change this setting, issue the following command:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set OPENSTRING &#60;newstring&#62;</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>SPLITTIME</title>

      <para>OPSB is very sensitive to timedrifts on the IRC network. In order
      to not scan users that might be part of a Netjoin (When two IRC servers
      reconnect after a Netsplit) we only scan users who&#39;s signon time is
      less than this setting. If your IRC network times are not in sync, you
      might experience issues where users connecting to one &#34;lagged&#34;
      out server are not scanning. In this case, you should fix the time on
      the affected server. A last resort is to increase this time value. By
      default, we only scan users that connected in the last 300 seconds</para>

      <para>To Change this setting, issue the following command:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set SPLITTIME &#60;seconds&#62;</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>SCANMSG Setting</title>

      <para>This setting changes the default message that is sent to users
      when they sign on the IRC network. You can customise this message to
      point to a webpage giving more details, or customize to your local
      language. </para>

      <para>To Change the setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg OPSB set SCANMSG &#60;msg&#62; </screen>

    <title>Operational Commands</title>

    <para>OPSB has a number of commands that you can issue it in order to
    perform checks or operations on your IRC network. These commands aid
    Administrators in keeping their network secure, and keeping OPSB upto
    date.</para>
